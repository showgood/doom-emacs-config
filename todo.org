* ✔ DONE disable hl-line-mode in terminal buffer
* ☛ TODO make all commands with spc prefix work in dired buffer
* ✔ DONE make term-mode play nicely with evil-mode
* ☛ TODO enable C-y for term-paste in term-mode
* ☛ TODO better experience with jump mark
basically we need to call *evil-scroll-line-to-center*
so the jumping location is always in the center of screen,
not at top or bottom

first try:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defadvice evil-goto-mark-line (after evil-scroll-line-to-center activate)
  (interactive)
)
#+END_SRC
not working..
* ☛ TODO enable hjkl navigation in magit buffer
* ☛ TODO change ediff colorscheme for better visual effect when diff
currently it's really hard to see the difference
* major mode for viewing log file
